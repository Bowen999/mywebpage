abstract: Pangenomes are crucial for comprehending the genetic diversity of fungi that cause infections in crops and humans, providing insights into their ecology, pathobiology, and evolutionary mechanisms. However, fungal pangenome databases have been lacking. In this study, the first fungal pangenome database is introduced, focusing on the Fusarium oxysporum species complex (FOSC), a group of devastating vascular wilt pathogens affecting over 100 plant species and causing life-threatening fusariosis in immunocompromised humans. Named the F. oxysporum Pangenome Database (FoPGDB), this resource integrates 31 high-quality FOSC genomes and offers robust analytical tools. FoPGDB enables gene-based and graph-based exploration of the F. oxysporum pangenome, including a curated repository of putative effector sequences essential for understanding FOSC's pathogenicity mechanisms. It provides functionalities such as gene search, genomic variant exploration, and tools for functional enrichment, facilitating in-depth investigations of the genetic diversity and adaptability of F. oxysporum. The database's user-friendly interface ensures efficient data access and interpretation, making it a valuable resource for F. oxysporum research and aiding in the development of novel disease management strategies.

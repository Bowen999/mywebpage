abstract: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Ag+ ions are both detected in aquatic environments, posing potential risks to marine ecosystems. Mytilus galloprovincialis is an effective model for monitoring marine environments. In this study, AgNPs were synthesized using a chemical approach, and to distinguish the toxicological effects of AgNPs and AgNO3 in M. galloprovincialis, experiments were conducted using various treatments (control, AgNO3, AgNPs, and AgNPs + cysteine). Our findings revealed that the uptake rate of AgNPs and AgNO3 was different, they predominantly accumulated in the hepatopancreas and gills. qRT-PCR analysis showed varying degrees of alterations in immune genes of HSPA12A, TCTP, sHSP22, sHSP24.1, P63, Bcl-2, and Ras. Histopathological analysis demonstrated disrupted epithelial cell arrangements and connective tissue damage in the hepatopancreas, with the AgNPs exhibiting the most severe damage compared to AgNO3. In addition, AgNPs significantly induced oxidative stress in hemocytes compared to AgNO3, resulting in elevated apoptosis rates. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the AgNPs and AgNO3 interactions in marine environments and provide a theoretical basis for the evaluation of marine pollution and biomonitoring strategies.

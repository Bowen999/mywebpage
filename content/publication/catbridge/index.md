abstract: The advancements in sequencing and mass spectrometry technologies have enabled the acquisition of multi-omics data, opening avenues for multi-angles analysis of complex biological systems. However, significant challenges remain in interpreting such data, particularly in identifying genes involved in crucial metabolite synthesis. To address these issues, we present Cat Bridge, a novel tool designed for correlational analysis between longitudinal multi-omics data analysis. Cat Bridge with a novel putative gene heuristic ranking method that combines data-driven strategies and prior knowledge to circumvent the limitations of traditional correlation methods. It is accessible in three formats - a web server, a standalone application, and a Python package - catering to diverse user requirements. We validated the robustness and effectiveness of Cat Bridge using self-generated data from chili peppers and public multi-omics data from humans, successfully identifying the biosynthesis genes for capsaicin and glucose and providing comprehensive statistical results. The integration of AI-assisted mechanistic explanations into Cat Bridge further enhanced its appeal, presenting a holistic, user-friendly solution for longitudinal multi-omics data analysis.

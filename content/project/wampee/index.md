### Abstract
* In the study, four c-type lectins were identified and characterized from the manila clam Venerupis philippinarum (designed as VpClec-1, VpClec-2, VpClec-3 and VpClec4 respectively).   
* Multiple alignments and phylogenetic analysis strongly suggested that they were new members of the c-type lectin superfamily.  
* After Vibrio anguillarum challenge, the temporal expression of all c-type lectins transcripts was up-regulated.  
* They displayed broad agglutination and antibacterial activities towards Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio splendidus, Vibrio anguillarum, Enterobacter cloacae and Aeromonas hydrophila.   
* All the results showed that four C-type lectins functioned as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) with distinct recognition spectrum, and involved in the innate immune responses of manila clams.

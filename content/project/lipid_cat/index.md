# Introduction
Lipidomics provides crucial insights into cellular processes and disease through the comprehensive analysis of lipids, primarily employing Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS). A persistent challenge in these MS-based analyses is the presence of contaminants originating from experimental materials. These contaminants complicate signal interpretation and can lead to misidentification of true analytes. Unlike other MS-based fields with established contaminant databases (e.g., CRAPome for proteomics, MaConDa for metabolomics), lipidomics has lacked a dedicated software solution for contaminant identification. We introduce Lipid CAT (Contaminant Analysis Tool), novel software that matches unknown MS/MS spectra against a specialized contaminant database, significantly improving lipidomics data accuracy.

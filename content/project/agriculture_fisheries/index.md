I work with biological researchers to explore various scientific topics in agriculture and fisheries using multi-omics methods. Including understanding how flavor molecules develop and how wampee resists sunburn, studying growth mechanisms in peas, and researching immune responses in shellfish.

I collaborate with Dr. Xiaoli Liu (Ludong University), Dr. Huiqiong Chen (Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences), and Dr. Hai Ying Yuan (National Research Council of Canada).

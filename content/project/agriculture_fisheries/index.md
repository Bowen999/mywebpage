I work with experts in agriculture and fisheries to explore various scientific questions using multi-omics methods. Including understanding how flavor molecules develop and how wampee resists sunburn, studying the growth mechanisms of peas, and researching immune responses in shellfish.

I closely collaborate with Dr. Xiaoli Liu (Ludong University), Dr. Huiqiong Chen (Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences), and Dr. Hai Ying Yuan f(National Research Council of Canada).

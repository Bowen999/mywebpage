abstract: Wampee (Clausena lansium) is an economically significant subtropical fruit tree widely cultivated in Southern China. To provide high-quality genomic resources for C. lansium, we report a chromosome-level genome sequence for the “JinFeng” cultivar. The 297.1 Mb C. lansium genome contained nine chromosomes with a scaffold N50 of 29.2 Mb and encoded 23,468 protein-coding genes. Selective sweep analysis between sweet and sour C. lansium varieties and genome-wide association analysis identified 14 candidate genes putatively involved in sugar and acid accumulation. ClERF061, encoding an ethylene response factor, and ClSWEET7, encoding a Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEET) family protein, were proposed as key regulators of the sweet and sour tastes of the wampee fruit. ClERF061 and ClSWEET7 overexpression in tomatoes increased the total sugar and acid content in fruits. ClSWEET7 promoter activation by ClERF061 was confirmed via Nicotiana benthamiana transient expression. Our study provides valuable genomic resources for C. lansium genetics and breeding.

abstract: Nano-zinc oxide (ZnO NPs), as widely used nanomaterials, are inevitably released into aquatic environments, posing potential threats to aquatic organisms. Mytilus galloprovincialis is a bivalve species sensitive to changes in marine ecological environments, but there has been limited research on its toxicity response to ZnO NPs. Therefore, we selected M. galloprovincialis as the research subject and exposed them to 50 Âµg/L ZnO NPs for 96 h and 30 days to determine the dissolution of ZnO NPs in seawater and their distribution in M. galloprovincialis. The toxicity of ZnO NPs in M. galloprovincialis was then evaluated through gene expression, tissue pathology, and cellular immune response. The results showed that ZnO NPs could enrich Zn in various tissues of the mussel, in the order of gills > hepatopancreas > adductor muscle > mantle. Seven immune-related genes including four heat shock protein genes (HSPA12A, sHSP24.1, sHSP22, TCTP) and three apoptotic genes (Ras, p63 and Bcl-2) were altered to varying degrees. There was a downward trend in lysosomal membrane stability of M. galloprovincialis after exposure to ZnO NPs for 96 h and 30 days, while ROS and apoptosis rates increased significantly. Furthermore, the seven genes, apoptosis, LMS, and ROS were dependent on exposure time, treatment, and their interaction. Histopathological damage included disorganisation of hepatopancreas epithelial cells, gill filament swelling, and contraction of blood sinuses. These results indicated that ZnO NPs exerted toxicity in M. galloprovincialis, affecting the immune system, resulting in changes in the expression of immune-related genes and ultimately leading to histopathological changes. Our research findings could contribute to systematically understand the impact of ZnO NPs on bivalves in aquatic environments and provide a theoretical basis for marine pollution assessment.
